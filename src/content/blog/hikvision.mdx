## How to Reset Hikvision DVR Password Using SADP Tool

**How to Reset Hikvision DVR Password Using SADP Tool**
If you've forgotten the password for your Hikvision DVR (Digital Video Recorder) or NVR (Network Video Recorder), you can easily reset it using the SADP (Search Active Devices Protocol) tool. SADP is a free software utility provided by Hikvision that allows users to locate and manage Hikvision devices on the network. Additionally, it provides a simple way to reset passwords when you're locked out of your device.\*\*

### What You’ll Need

**Before you begin, make sure you have the following:**

-**A Hikvision DVR/NVR device that you need to reset**<br />
-**A computer connected to the same local network as the DVR**<br />
-**The SADP Tool installed on your computer (downloadable from the Hikvision website).**<br />
-**The serial number of your DVR/NVR (you’ll need this to generate a reset request).**<br />
-**A valid email address (you’ll use this to receive a reset password file from Hikvision support).**

## Step 1: Download and Install the SADP Tool

### Go to the Hikvision website:<br />

Download the SADP tool from the official Hikvision website by navigating to the Support section, then to Downloads, and searching for the SADP tool under the Software tab.<br />

### 1. Download and Install the SADP Tool

-Go to the official Hikvision website and download the SADP tool.<br />
-Install it on your computer following the on-screen instructions.<br />

### 2.Launch the SADP Tool

-Open the SADP tool on your computer after installation.<br />
-The tool will automatically scan the local network for Hikvision devices.<br />

### 3.Find Your DVR in SADP

-After launching the tool, it will show a list of Hikvision devices on your network (e.g., DVR, NVR, IP cameras).<br />
-Locate your DVR in the list. You should see the device's IP address, Serial Number, Device Name, and Firmware Version.<br />

### 4.Reset the Password

-Select the DVR: Click on your DVR’s entry in the list of devices.<br />
-Password Reset: If you don’t know the password, you’ll see an option like “Forgot Password” or something related to resetting the password.<br />
-Generate Reset File: Click on the "Forgot Password" or similar option, and the SADP tool will provide an option to generate a reset file. It will ask you to provide the verification code, which can be found in the tool interface under the DVR’s settings.<br />

### 5.Provide Device Information to Hikvision Support

-Get the Serial Number: Take note of your DVR's serial number and the verification code shown in SADP.<br />
-Submit Information to Hikvision: Contact Hikvision support (usually via email or a web portal) to request a password reset. Provide them with the serial number and verification code. They will generate a file for you to reset the password.<br />

### 6.Upload the Reset File

Once you receive the reset file from Hikvision support, return to the SADP tool.<br />
You’ll have an option to browse and upload the reset file that Hikvision provided.<br />
After uploading the file, the password for the DVR will be reset to a default value (usually “12345” or another simple password, depending on the model).<br />

### 7.Change the Password

-After resetting the password, you should log into your DVR using the new credentials.<br />
-It is highly recommended that you change the default password to a secure one after logging in.<br /> <a href="https:/dahua-dubai.com" target="_blank" rel="dofollow">Contact Us</a>
